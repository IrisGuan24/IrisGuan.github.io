Brief
======
The research explores the representation of Ukrainian females in Western media coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict since February 2022. Employing a corpus-based Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA), it examines both verbal and visual narratives in the news, focusing on the portrayal of vulnerability and empowerment among Ukrainian women.

Methodologies
======
A mixed-method approach combining corpus linguistics, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), and Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) was employed. The analysis focused on 391 news articles and 400 images from The Guardian, analyzed through the lens of social actor's framework and visual grammar theories.

Key results
======

##  Linguistic Representations

Identified two primary discourses—suffering and empowerment. Women were often depicted in terms of vulnerability, victimization, and familial roles, contrasting with representations of their participation as soldiers, activists, and professionals.
