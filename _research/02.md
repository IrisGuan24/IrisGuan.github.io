Brief
======
-   In recent decades, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has led to the increasing use of AI speaking apps in foreign language learning.
-   The research explored the burgeoning intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning, with a specific focus on speaking skills. 
-   The study investigates the impact of social network-based interaction on students’ English speaking practice with the assistance of AI speaking apps in China. 
-   It underlines the importance of interactive learning in the digital age, offering insights into how technology can be leveraged to foster better language learning outcomes.

***

Key research questions
======
1. What are EFL learners’ perceptions of social network-based interactive activities when practicing oral English with AI speaking apps?

2. How effectively can social network-based interactions help EFL learners to practice oral English with AI speaking apps?

***

Methodologies & My responsibilities
======
-   Recruiting 70 students from different Chinese universities to practice speaking skills with AI apps for five weeks.
-   Dividing them into two groups. Participants in the experimental group were encouraged to engage in various interactive activities when practicing speaking with AI apps, while those in the control group were asked to use AI speaking apps without interaction. 
-   Collecting data through pre- and post-questionnaires, pre-and post-tests and semi-structured interviews.
-   Analyzing quantitative data with SPSS while analyzing qualitative data with Nvivo.

Results
======

## 1.Students' Perceptions of AI-Assisted Learning with Social Interaction

###  1.1 General Attitude: 

The majority of participants held positive views towards using AI apps combined with social networking for learning English, appreciating the interactive features for enhancing their speaking practice.

###  1.2 Engagement and Motivation: 

Notably, students in the experimental group, who engaged with social network-based interactions, showed higher levels of engagement and motivation compared to the control group, emphasizing the value of interactive activities.

##  2.Effectivness on Speaking Skills

###  2.1 Perceived improvement:

EG held significantly stronger views than those in the CG that the AI speaking apps helped them practice their oral fluency (PI1), grammatical range and accuracy (PI2), pronunciation (PI3), oral rhythm (PI4), idea organization skills (PI5), reading aloud skills (PI6), and presentation skills (PI7)
