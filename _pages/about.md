I’m widely interested in the intersection of Educational Technology, Applied Linguistics and Instructional Design.

Specifically, My research focuses on leveraging AI and VR technologies to improve learners’ language learning. I’m currently a member of the research group of <a href='https://sites.google.com/tc.columbia.edu/al-tesol-language-technology/home?authuser=0'>ALTESOL: Language & Technology (L&T)</a>at Teachers College, Columbia Unviersity.

I’m also open to the research fields of applying educational technologies in STEM Education and Media Literacy based on my research experience at The <a href='https://ctsc.tc.columbia.edu/' >Center for Technology and School Change (CTSC) </a>and <a href='https://www.masclab.org/'>https://www.masclab.org/</a> Media And Social Change Lab (MASClab) at Teachers College, Columbia University.
